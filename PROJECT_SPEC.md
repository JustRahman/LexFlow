# Project: LexFlow

## Overview
LexFlow is a micro-SaaS platform that streamlines client intake and e-signing for solo attorneys and small law firms. It replaces manual onboarding workflows (PDFs, phone calls, mailed forms) with a secure, paperless flow that automates:
- Client information collection
- Retainer agreement e-signatures
- Initial payment processing

## Core Goals
- Save lawyers time by automating client intake.
- Improve client experience with an easy, mobile-friendly process.
- Ensure legal and data compliance (audit logs, secure document storage).
- Be affordable and simple to adopt for small firms (2â€“10 attorneys).
