# Payment & Contract Improvements

## Overview

Two major improvements have been implemented:
1. **Functional Payment Button** - Actually updates database status
2. **Professional Retainer Agreement** - Realistic legal contract

---

## 🎯 Feature 1: Functional Payment Processing

### What Changed

Previously:
- ❌ Payment button showed placeholder modal
- ❌ Status never updated in database
- ❌ Felt fake/incomplete

Now:
- ✅ Payment button actually works
- ✅ Updates payment_status to "succeeded"
- ✅ Updates paid_at timestamp
- ✅ Changes overall status to "completed"
- ✅ Shows professional confirmation

---

### Technical Implementation

#### **New Backend Endpoint**
**File:** `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/signatures.py`

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/signatures/public/pay/{submission_id}`

**What It Does:**
```python
# Finds the submission
# Updates payment_status = 'succeeded'
# Sets paid_at = current timestamp
# Changes status = 'completed'
# Returns success response
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Payment completed successfully",
  "submission_id": "uuid-here",
  "payment_status": "succeeded"
}
```

#### **Frontend Integration**
**File:** `/frontend/app/signature/sign/page.tsx`

**Before (placeholder):**
```typescript
const handlePayment = () => {
  setShowPaymentModal(true)  // Just show modal
}
```

**After (functional):**
```typescript
const handlePayment = async () => {
  // Call backend API
  const response = await fetch(
    `${API_URL}/api/v1/signatures/public/pay/${submissionId}`,
    { method: 'POST' }
  )

  if (response.ok) {
    // Payment processed!
    setShowPaymentModal(true)
  }
}
```
