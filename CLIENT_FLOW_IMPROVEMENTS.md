## 📋 New Client Journey

### **Step 1: Client Fills Intake Form**
**URL:** `/intake/[formId]`

**Features:**
- Dynamic form fields based on lawyer configuration
- Required field validation

### **Step 2A: Payment Required Path**

If lawyer requires payment:

**Payment Success Page** (`/payment/success`):
- ✅ Verifies payment with backend

---

### **Step 2B: No Payment Required Path**

If no payment required:

1. **Submit form** → Direct redirect to **Intake Success Page**

| N/A           | N/A              | Review step only                            |
| Pending       | N/A              | Payment pending + Review                    |
| Succeeded     | N/A              | Payment complete ✓ + Review                 |
| Succeeded     | Sent             | Payment ✓ + Signature sent + Review         |
