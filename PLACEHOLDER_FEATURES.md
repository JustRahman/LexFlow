### Files Modified

#### **1. Dashboard Page**
**File:** `/frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Added:**
- `showStripeModal` state
- Green banner component
- Modal component
- Click handler

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
const [showStripeModal, setShowStripeModal] = useState(false)

// Banner
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50...">
  <button onClick={() => setShowStripeModal(true)}>
    Connect Stripe Account
  </button>
</div>

// Modal
{showStripeModal && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0...">
    // Modal content
  </div>
)}
```

#### **2. Signature Page**

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
const [signed, setSigned] = useState(false)
const [showPaymentModal, setShowPaymentModal] = useState(false)

const handleSign = async () => {
  // Submit signature
  setSigned(true)
  // Don't redirect immediately
}

const handlePayment = () => {
  setShowPaymentModal(true)
}

const handlePaymentModalClose = () => {
  setShowPaymentModal(false)
  // Redirect to success
  window.location.href = `/intake/success?submission_id=${submissionId}`
}

// Conditional rendering
{!signed ? (
  // Signature form
) : (
  // Payment section
  <button onClick={handlePayment}>Pay Now</button>
)}
```

## ðŸš€ When Real Stripe is Ready

### To Enable Real Payments

#### **Lawyer Side (Dashboard):**
Replace modal with:
```typescript
const handleStripeConnect = () => {
  // Redirect to Stripe OAuth
  window.location.href = stripeConnectUrl
}
```

#### **Client Side (Signature Page):**
Replace placeholder with:
```typescript
const handlePayment = () => {
  // Redirect to real Stripe checkout
  if (submission.payment_url) {
    window.location.href = submission.payment_url
  }
}
```

### Backend Changes Needed
1. Implement Stripe Connect OAuth flow
2. Store connected account IDs
3. Use connected accounts for payments
4. Handle webhooks properly

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State vs Future

### Current (Placeholder)
| Feature | Status | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Lawyer Connect | Modal only | Shows coming soon |
| Client Payment | Modal only | Shows coming soon |
| Database | Not updated | Signature still saves |
| Redirect | Success page | After modal dismissed |

### Future (Real Stripe)
| Feature | Status | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|

| Client Payment | Functional | Real Stripe checkout |
| Database | Updated | Payment status tracked |
| Redirect | Stripe, then success | Real payment flow |
